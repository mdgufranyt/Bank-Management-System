Developed a Java-based ATM Simulator System that mimics the core functionalities of a real-world ATM. The system allows users to interact with banking operations through a simple command-line interface. Key features include:

Account Creation: Users can open new bank accounts by providing essential details.

Deposit & Withdrawal: Secure deposit and withdrawal operations with balance validation.

Mini Statement: Displays a detailed list of recent transactions.

PIN Change: Enables users to update their ATM PIN securely.

User Authentication: Validates user credentials before granting access to features.

Data Handling: Utilized file handling for persistent data storage (or use "JDBC/Database" if you used DB).

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming, exception handling, input validation, and user-friendly CLI design
